# TODO

# We use .NET SDK version 6.0 for the build.

# Run the build scripts:
#  - src/web/restore.sh
#  - src/web/build.sh
#  you'll need to make the files executable first with chmod +x <filename>.


# Build output is in the folder:
#  /out

# The app should run using a .NET ASP.NET 6.0 image, with a minimal OS.
 
# We need to set four environment variables - 
# DOTNET_VERSION and APP_VERSION - for ops usage
# Widgetario__ProductsApi__Url set to "http://products-api/products"
# Widgetario__StockApi__Url set to "http://stock-api:8080/stock"

# The startup command needs to run the DLL from the build:
#  dotnet Widgetario.Web.dll
